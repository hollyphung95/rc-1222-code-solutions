<!-- What HTML Tag is used to link to another website -->
The <a> opening tag and the </a> closing tag are used when creating a link.
The <a> element has an href attribute.
The href attribute has a value of the disired page post clicking on the link.
In this case, the full web address for the site (aka the absolute URL)




<!-- What is an absolute URL -->
Its the Full Web address for the site.
An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site,
and can be followed by the path to a specific page.
If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.





<!-- What is a relative URL -->
When you are linking to other pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL.
(You can use relative URLs, its just shorthand version of absolute URL)

If all the pages of the site are in the same folder,
then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.
